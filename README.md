### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">, I'm Rajat.
I am a full stack developer hailing from India, who works on cutting-edge software on weekdays and enjoys exploring mountains on weekends. I am passionate about technology and find joy in developing elegant solutions to complex problems. My interest lies in building large-scale systems that use sophisticated technologies, which not only challenge me but also drive me to enhance my skills constantly. The challenge of creating such systems is a constant source of inspiration for me, and I am committed to making a positive impact by building robust and beautiful software.
